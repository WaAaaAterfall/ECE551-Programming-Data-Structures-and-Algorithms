Attempting to compile test.c
gcc -Wall -std=gnu99 -pedantic -c test.c
gcc -o test test.o
compiled
I expected to find a file called 'answer.txt' but it did not exist
(or was not a regular file)
Here are the files that I can find:
answers.txt
Makefile
README
test
test.c
test.o
Your output did not match what we expected.

Overall Grade: F
