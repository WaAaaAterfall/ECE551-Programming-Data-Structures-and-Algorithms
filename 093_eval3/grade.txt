Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
make: 'cyoa-step1' is up to date.
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------


1.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


1.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean
------------------------------------
You have requested that we check for intermediate deadline completion on step 1
------------------------------------

Step 1 EC intermediate deadline test 1
===========================================================
./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean for this testcase
You have passed this test case

Step 1 EC intermediate deadline test 2
===========================================================
./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean for this testcase
You have passed this test case
Intermediate deadline requirements for Step 1 passed at Sun Nov 20 10:30:05 PM EST 2022

Step 2
Checking that cyoa-step2 compiles
The code did not compile!

Overall Grade: NO GRADE YET
