Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2 cyoa-step3 cyoa-step4  cyoa-step1.o  cyoa-step2.o  cyoa-step3.o  cyoa-step4.o
g++ -o cyoa-step1 -ggdb3 -Wall -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu++98 cyoa-step1.cpp util.cpp
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------


1.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


1.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


1.3: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 storyTest < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
This story contains undefined page (not N, W nor L).
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


1.4: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 storyTest2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---

You have NOT passed your test cases!
You should go and figure out/understand where thing went wrong
And fix the problem(s) before the deadline
