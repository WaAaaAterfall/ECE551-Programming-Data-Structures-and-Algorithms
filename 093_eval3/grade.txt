Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2 cyoa-step3 cyoa-step4  cyoa-step1.o  cyoa-step2.o  cyoa-step3.o  cyoa-step4.o
g++    -c -o util.o util.cpp
g++ -o cyoa-step1 -ggdb3 -Wall -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu++98 cyoa-step1.cpp util.cpp
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------

Valgrind was clean


2.47: Current test is ./cyoa-step2 storyTest25  <  storyTest25/inputs/input0.txt
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
There are pages that are not referenced in this story.

Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 2

Step 3
Checking that cyoa-step3 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2 cyoa-step3 cyoa-step4  cyoa-step1.o  cyoa-step2.o  cyoa-step3.o  cyoa-step4.o
g++ -o cyoa-step3 -ggdb3 -Wall -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu++98 cyoa-step3.cpp util.cpp
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step3 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 3
------------------------------------
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 3

Step 4
Checking that cyoa-step4 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2 cyoa-step3 cyoa-step4  cyoa-step1.o  cyoa-step2.o  cyoa-step3.o  cyoa-step4.o
g++ -o cyoa-step4 -ggdb3 -Wall -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu++98 cyoa-step4.cpp util.cpp
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step4 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 4
------------------------------------
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 4

You have NOT passed your test cases!
You should go and figure out/understand where thing went wrong
And fix the problem(s) before the deadline
